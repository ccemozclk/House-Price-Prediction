# House-Price-Prediction

Data science, which is known as the oil of the digital age, and data science, which is a science that has emerged to be used for the benefit of people by processing data correctly and extracting meaningful information, continues to create new normals in most areas of our lives. So much so that 10 years ago, it was a very difficult situation that we could know who would win a league cup competition before it was played in any way, or as another example, when we applied for a loan to a bank years ago, we had to fulfill various procedures. However, today, in the sports industry, the outcome of the competition can be predicted with data science and artificial intelligence algorithms, and by using various algorithms, it is possible to accurately predict whether a bank customer applying for a loan will be able to repay the loan he has received, and possible money losses can be avoided.

In this case, as summarized in the paragraph above, we will establish a machine learning model that determines the price of the house according to the features it has (square meter size of the residential area, number of rooms, heating type, square meter size of the house's garage and distance to the street, etc.). For this study, we will be using the XGBoost Regressor algorithm, which provides high predictive power.
